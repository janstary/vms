Everything breaks with ORCA 4.0.1:
  ori: 'CARTESIAN COORDINATES (ANGSTROEM)'
  not found in ./excited/molecule.000001
  ori: no excited states in './excited/molecule.000001'
  ori: number of states 0 != 1 state for root 3 in './excited/molecule.000001'
  ori: 'CARTESIAN COORDINATES (ANGSTROEM)'
  not found in ./excited/molecule.000002
  ori: no excited states in './excited/molecule.000002'
  ori: number of states 0 != 1 state for root 3 in './excited/molecule.000002'

ori /tmp/single
ori /tmp/optimize
ori /tmp/excited
	Document the different functionality and different output in ori.1

ori
	needs to have a -q mode where it _only_
	writes molecules to stdout and eval to stderr,
	to e used by mm(1)

test molecule in vms
	have  small molecule to test first if the method + basis
	is reasonable at all, as opposed to failing a thousand times

maxdim,iroot,triplets
	undocummented

molecule names
	Name the molecules as "%m-%b-molecule.%d" by default,
	or let the user say "names string" to have string.*
	(see streams.c in recall, _fmtsname())

filter inbetween ORCAs
	"ori ... file" as opposed to "ori ... dir"
	means check the one molecule, and return yes/no
	with respect to filters
	Then make vms -D delete the bad ones immediately
	(to save possibly huge space in the orcadir)

globals
	The request and molecules and havemols etc are global now,
	but that could be avoided

realloc()
	replace with the safer reallocarray()

atoi/strtol
	replace with the safer strtonum()

	https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/excited-state-calculations/tddft

methods:
	Try HF-3C as well, without specifying a basis set.
	Try other relevant methods

ori parallelization?
	How expensive is ori with respect to the whole?
	If the overhead is substantial should we have ori -j too?

parser:
	basis set can be a multiword
	implement $ escape for direct-to-orca, as in
		$ %tddft
		$  maxdim 30
		$  end

portability:
	Test on all MacOSX (64bit) and Linux (64bit)
	https://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de/downloads.php?cat=9
	ORCA runs on no other POSIX platforms.
